# RDBMS-Fast-Food-Franchise
I have created a RDBMS for a fast food franchise FastFood with as many outlets as wishes. The database is a prototype to cover a specific part of FastFood ordering system. The owner of the franchise can see which member of staff takes the most orders and what are the most popular orders taken. The owner can to track if the customer pays by cash or card. The owner can collate this information for all the outlets. There are two menus that the customer can chose from â€” the regular menu and the savers menu. All of the products sold can either be on the regular menu or on the savers menu. The regular menu has a breakfast section that finishes at chosen time each day. The savers menu has a start and end date.
